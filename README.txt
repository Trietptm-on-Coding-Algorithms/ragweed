Ragweed is a set of scriptable debugging tools written mostly in native ruby.

Where required the Ruby/DL and Win32API libraries are used to interface the machine
and OS native system calls.

This suite is currently fairly piecemeal. Each OS has it's own set of tools.
The most complete set is for Win32.

Work is ongoing to complete and unify the OSX and Linux portions.
